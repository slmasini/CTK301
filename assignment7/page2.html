    <p class="p3"><span class="redletters">Klaus.</span> Klaus Hargreeves is one of the forty-three children who were all born on the same day in 1989 to mothers without any previous signs of pregnancy. The baby was one of seven adopted by Sir Reginald Hargreeves with the intention of training them to save the world. Ranked by their individual usefulness, Klaus was Hargreeves' Number Four with the ability to speak to the dead. His tendency to speak German, and his name, suggest he was possibly born to a woman in Germany. </p>

    <p class="p3"><span class="redletters">Vanya.</span> Vanya Hargreeves is one of the forty-three children who were all born on the same day in 1989, to a mother without any previous signs of pregnancy. The baby was one of seven adopted by Sir Reginald Hargreeves with the intention of training them to save the world. Unlike her six adoptive siblings, Vanya seemingly has no superpowers. She had a talent for violin, and when she was an adult wrote an autobiography about her life as the ordinary member of The Umbrella Academy.</p>
